The baseline entity annotation file had a tab-separated format with columns corresponding to the article identifier, the part of the document processed (T: title, A: abstract), the start and end characters offsets of the chemical, the text string of the chemical entity mention and the corresponding chemical entity mention class."^^xsd:string ;

The difficulty and consistency of tagging chemicals in text was measured using an agreement study between annotators, obtaining a percentage agreement of 91."^^xsd:string .
